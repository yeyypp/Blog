If you don't push yourself, you don't find out where the boundaries of your current skill level are, and you don't fall, you don't get in better.

If you don't have what you want, stop telling yourself the story because of you don't have the money, you don't have the time, that's bullshit. It's because you haven't committed yourself where you would burn your boats. If you want to take the island, burn your fucking boats and you will take the island. Because people when they are gonna either die or succeed, tend to succeed. But most of us give ourselves a way out and that is why we don't have what we want.

You have to be self-disciplined. It's necessary! For everything you do in your life.

It's all start by making a little change and adding to it everyday.

What happen is, a lot of people set goals. And they have this big goal and they look at it like this giant staircase."That seems impossible.I'can't. There is no way. It looks too hard. It looks too much work." And they don't ever start. They set a goal, yeah, "I want to be at the top of the staircase." It is easy to write that down. But when they go to actually start climbing it, they just go:"I can't...that's so ....I'm not sure..." 

But if all you did was just look at the first step and get on that first step, and then, when you are on that step, just look at the next step. That's it. Don't look up. Just look at the next step.

Stop thinking, make a small plan everyday and stick to it, step by step.
