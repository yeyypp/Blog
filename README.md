# Life springs from suffering and calamity, death comes from ease and pleasure.

What happen is, a lot of people set goals. And they have this big goal and they look at it like this giant staircase."That seems impossible.I'can't. There is no way. It looks too hard. It looks too much work." And they don't ever start. They set a goal, yeah, "I want to be at the top of the staircase." It is easy to write that down. But when they go to actually start climbing it, they just go:"I can't...that's so ....I'm not sure..." 

But if all you did was just look at the first step and get on that first step, and then, when you are on that step, just look at the next step. That's it. Don't look up. Just look at the next step.

Stop thinking, make a small plan everyday and stick to it, step by step.
