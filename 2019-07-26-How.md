# How did I end up here?

The more I thought myself left behind by not only the peers, but also the people who are younger than me,
the more I thought I've never be able to catch up with them.

I failed my girl, I failed my parents, I let them down.

I don't deserve love, I don't deserve to eat.

I feel that there is so so much to learn that I will never be able to know enough to get the job.

I'm too old to get a job, they say when you get to 35 year old, you will get fired by the company.

I'm too old to catch up with others, I can't.

I wish there is someone that can tell me that it is ok, I wish there is someone can tell me what to learn to get a good job.

I think I've been wasting time to learn things that couldn't get me a job.

All my efforts were in vain.
