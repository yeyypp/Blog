# I'm 26 I'm a shit
How did I end up here

The more I thought myself left behind by not only the peers, but also the people who are younger than me,
the more I thought I've never be able to catch up with them.

I failed my girl, I failed my parents, I let them down. 

I don't deserve love, I don't deserve to eat.

I'm a loser and a failure.

I feel ashamed of myself.

I feel that there is so so much to learn that I will never be able to know enough to get the job.

I'm too old to get a job, they say when you get to 35 year old, you will get fired by the company.

I'm too old to catch up with others, I can't.

I wish there is someone can tell me that it is ok, I wish there is someone can tell me what exactly to learn to get a job.

I think I've been wasting time to learn things that couldn't get me a job.

All my efforts were in vain.

I'm sorry, sorry mom,dad.
I'm so sorry that I can't make you proud.
