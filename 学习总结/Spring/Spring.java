     * The difference between spring-web and spring-webmvc
     * spring-web provides core HTTP integration, including some handy Servlet filters, Spring HTTP Invoker,
     * infrastructure to integrate with other web frameworks and HTTP technologies e.g. Hessian, Burlap.
     *
     * spring-webmvc is an implementation of Spring MVC. spring-webmvc depends on on spring-web,
     * thus including it will transitively add spring-web. You don't have to add spring-web explicitly.
     *
     * You should depend only on spring-web if you don't use Spring MVC but want to
     * take advantage of other web-related technologies that Spring supports.
